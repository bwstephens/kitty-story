# Preface {-}

![](img/catplanet.jpg)

We wanted to do something different in this book. I wanted to do a joint work with my brother, Felix, so I had the idea of writing a book about his stuff cat, Kitty. Felix came up with with the story about Cat Planet. It was natural for me to write down the story and then have Felix color the pictures. This was a fun collaboration, and we're already planning the next book in the series. We hope you enjoy this new series.
